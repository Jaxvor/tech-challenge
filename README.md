The technical_challenge_AaronS.spec.js file is a javascript file containing tests to run against this app https://computer-database.gatling.io/computers

In order to install Cypress on your local machine, you will need to visit: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/installing-cypress

Follow the instructions via the link above to either install Cypress via npm in your IDE (I use Visual Studio Code, for example) or download the Cypress files directly from: https://download.cypress.io/desktop

If you downloaded the Cypress files directly, you will need to unzip the file to a location of your choice. Once unzipped, Cypress can then be run from the Cypress.exe file located in your new Cypress folder.

Once you have installed Cypress you can run the exe. You will be presented with Cypress's Start page ("To get started..."). From here you can select the Project folder for Cypress tests. Before you select the Project folder make sure that you add technical_challenge_AaronS.spec.js to the Projects folder. Open the Project from Cypress's home page and you will be taken to the second page of the app which presents the list of available test files to run.

The technical_challenge_AaronS.spec.js will appear in the list of INTEGRATION TESTS, click on this test.

The Test Runner will now open and run the tests in the file via a Chrome browser window. The tests will execute and feedback successful and failed tests in the Test Runner.

From here there is full documenation on Cypress's site which will cover creating your own test files and writing your own tests: https://docs.cypress.io/guides/getting-started/writing-your-first-test#Add-a-test-file 

## This was the first time I installed and used Cypress so forgive me if I missed anything obvious in the setup instructions :)
